### Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram

### Ans.

- Execution context refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed.
- It includes variables, functions, and other resources that are accessible during the runtime of a script.
  -Each time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created.

```
var a =10;
var b=25;
var c=30;

 function sum(){
    var a=10;
    var b=20;
    console.log(a+b);
 }

 sum();
```

- In the space part it scanned and all variables get undefined;
- then code value comes and undefined value replaces with the value.
  -So for function again function execution context was made, in code position of the global execution context.
