## HTML QUESTIONS:

#### 1. No it is not a tag of html, DOCTYPE tells the browser, about the version of the html page is being written by the developer.

#### 2. Semantic tags are also normal tags, just they tell us the meaning of the content that they contain. For example: header, section, aside, footer etc.

#### 3. HTML tags are the building blocks of the html page as it only contains the tag.

For eg:

```
 <div></div>, <h1></h1>, <section></section> etc.
```

these all are tags, but element means tags + the content in it.
